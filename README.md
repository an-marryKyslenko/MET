# THE MET

The MET showcases skills in HTML and CSS. The site was developed using the BEM methodology, which is based on the idea of breaking the user interface into independent and reusable components. To simplify the syntax and improve code structure, the Sass preprocessor was used. There are also examples of anumation and extensive use of the Grid.
